After substituting placeholders with values from the variables map, \n  the reconstructed line must exactly match the raw log.\n  \n  Note 2: When the same type of BUSINESS DATA appears multiple times within a single log entry, \n  use indexed variable names to avoid ambiguity (e.g., \"ip1\", \"ip2\").\n  \n  Note 3: Do NOT treat long texts as standalone messages.
